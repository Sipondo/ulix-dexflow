# Ulix: Dexflow
Dexflow is a framework for building (fan)games inspired by the Pok√©mon series of games.
As with any Ulix framework, Dexflow expands Ulix' functionality with features usually found in these kinds of games.
The framework falls under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Any used assets and libraries fall under their own respective licenses.

# Basic Usage
You can either clone the repo directly, or patch the repo on an existing Ulix folder.
Python version 3.8 is heavily recommended as it ensures compatibility with the [Ulix Particle Forge](https://github.com/Sipondo/ulix-particle-forge).

Please install any dependencies by running `setup.bat`.

Before your first time playing the game, and after making any changes to the world, you will need to compile the LDTK world file.

Run `compile_world.bat` to generate the compressed world file, after which your game can be played via `game.bat`.
